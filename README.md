WishhoffRichies — Live ✅

I just finished building a working MVP for WishhoffRichies — a platform that connects people with honest needs to generous donors.

Live site: https://<your-render-url>
What you can do:
- Create a wish (Tell your story + ask for an amount)
- Browse wishes from others
- Donate securely via Stripe

If you'd like onboarding or white-labeling, reply here and I’ll help with customization and advanced moderation features.
